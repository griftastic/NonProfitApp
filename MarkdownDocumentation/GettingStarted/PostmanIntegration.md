# Postman Integration

Now that you have your SQL Database updated, you need to bring in the functionality.

We used Postman to test out all of our endpoints.

We have conveniently provided a .json file to help you import our Postman Collection.

The file's name is:
NonProfitApp.postman_collection.json

Click [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#importing-postman-data) for the Postman tutorial on how to import a Postman Collection using a .json file.


You are now ready to start using our NonProfit App!
